# Iterative-Balancing-for-Entropy-Maximization
Demonstration of the Iterative Balancing Algorithm outlined in Davis 2023

Drawing inspiration from the Fratar method, this code solves a simple example of an entropy maximization
formulation similarly to a doubly constrained gravity model by iteratively adjusting 
the rows and columns of a matrix until they converge to an acceptable point
